![Build Website](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/actions/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml/badge.svg)

A bunch of useful information I've collected while studying at the Technical University of Munich.

The contributors imagined/came up with all of the course information in this repo randomly, including the grades.
All matches with real courses and grades are purely coincidental.

## How to contribute

### Course exam statistics

You can help expand this website with new information by adding your own course exam statistics!
In short, create a new issue based on this template by [going here](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=add_course_exam_statistics.md&title=%5BCourse%5D+CIT+IN0001+2022SS) and replace the values with your own data.
The description is copy-pasted onto the page directly and follows the markdown format (but you can use plain text too).
After some time, the statistics you have submitted will appear on the website.
For now there's a manual review step done by me, so don't worry too much about breaking the website.
When I see that everything is ok, I put a label on the issue and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/tree/main/.github/workflows)
take care of the rest by adding a new page to the website and building it.

### Feature requests and bug reports

There also are issue templates for such cases [back on GitHub](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/issues/new/choose).
If something is wrong or you want something to get better, here's what to do:
1. Create a new issue and outline what is wrong and/or what you need.
2. (Optionally) If you want to try and fix the issue, state it in a comment, fork the repo, make the changes, and submit a pull request.
