title: "Added Aamin's courses!"

Jolly spring to everyone!

Completely by accident I came across a link to [Aamin's website](https://stats.aamin.dev/) with grade reports from me and others. In the spirit of making a single full data source for grade reports, I have merged the grades from this website into TUM Info. Thanks to the CI/CD scripts that I wrote, the process wasn't as painful as it was last few times, so now the list of courses, schools and the API endpoints are all up-to-date.

In other news, [Aamin's website](https://stats.aamin.dev/) had a more accurate representation of B/N pass/fail grades without a numeric value, so I took the chance to update the TUM Info dataset to handle it properly too.

In case you stumble on this message and want to contribute your own grades, check out [the tutorial I wrote](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/#course-exam-statistics). It would be amazing if you could help out!
