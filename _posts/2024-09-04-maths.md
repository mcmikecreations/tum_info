title: "Fixed exam statistics calculations!"
---

Happy autumn/fall to everyone!

One of the long-standing issues on GitHub for this website was having wrong formulas for exam statistics.
The system worked in two passes: a crude Liquid implementation for initial data and for browsers with disabled JavaScript
and a JavaScript implementation based on D3 that updates the fields when all of the statistics load. This meant I needed to
update both pieces of code every time I changed something, which brought many bugs to the table. Finally, I decided to ditch
the JavaScript implementation completely and focus only on Liquid. This should fix statistics both in the list and on the pages.

In other news, I added some new courses, updated the AweTUM page, and updated the CI/CD GitHub Actions pipeline.
Also, changed some titles around to improve Google Ranking (I still don't use Google Analytics to avoid having tracking cookies).

If you want to support the website by contributing your own grades, check out [the tutorial I wrote](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/#course-exam-statistics). I'm looking forward to your submissions!
