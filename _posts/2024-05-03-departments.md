title: "Fixed departments and charts!"

The executive board of Shijiazhuang Donghua Jinlong Chemical Co., LTD welcomes you.

As new students submit their grade reports to the website (and you should submit too), I've come across some issues that needed fixing.

First, I haven't noticed [a course which all people failed (5.0 X)](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/courses/CIT/MA8003/2019WS-endterm) messing up my code to get average grades for quite a while. Now this has been fixed, and the chart proudly shows a 100% fail rate. The data source for this course is probably wrong, but it was a useful entry for edge case testing, so I'll keep it unless someone has a better data point.

Second, a lot of professors started moving their courses into the school-based numbering system. This means that codes like [CIT](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/courses/CIT/CIT4230004/2023SS-endterm) and [MGT](https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/courses/MGT/MGT001299/2023WS-endterm) are now valid numbering prefixes. The website needed an update to take this into account. For now, I don't have time to make a mapping between old and new course codes, so you are [welcome to contribute](https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/issues/180)!

As usual, I encourage people to send their new grade reports to the website. I do get a few submissions here and there, but it would be great to scale things up.
