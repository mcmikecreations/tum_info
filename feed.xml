Welcome to TUM Info.</p>

<p>A lot of students were complaining that grade reports are good, but don’t offer feedback from actual students taking the course. This has changed! On the new design, you can click on a course on the courses or schools page, which will send you to a page with all reviews. For example, <a href="https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/reviews/CIT/IN2064">Machine Learning</a>. The reviews are taken from the numerous chats created for study programs and specific courses.</p>

<p>If you have some free time, we are looking for volunteers to go through chat history and add it to the website. Contact us through the means listed <a href="https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/blob/87cd920fcb143dc31fa92d7e85c2fd9f1253ee73/scripts/course_glob_ui.py#L175">here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mykola Morozov</name><email>mcmikecreations@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, Internet!

You asked and I delivered.</p>

<p>An EPIC new website addition to all you thirsty developers is the public API. A short description for it
can be found on the <a href="https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/">ReadMe page</a>. But in summary,
I added a <a href="https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/api/description">Description page</a> with documentation
for every available endpoint and a <a href="https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/api/playground">Playground page</a>
where you can test out your own code. All course and school data on the website is available in the API,
so you can write your custom scripts or programs referencing it.</p>

<p>And another call to the website visitors. As the semester is over, don’t hesitate to contribute your grade distributions
to the website.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mykola Morozov</name><email>mcmikecreations@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top of the morning to you ladies!

And an exciting one, where a new major update came to the website!</p>

<p>First, I’ve added a new page to the website, <a href="https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/awetum/">AweTUM</a>,
featuring links to useful study resources and hobby projects of TUM students. If you have anything to add,
just PM/DM me the link with a short description. I hope to make the website a central point for useful
unofficial TUM-related stuff, so any help from you is highly welcome.</p>

<p>Second, I reworked the apps to accept unknown schools, departments and course formats.
This means you can safely ask your friends from Management, Architecture or Biology to contribute their grades!</p>

<p>Don’t forget that as the grades for the 2023SS have rolled out, you can contribute them here!
For that, check out the instructions in the <a href="https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/">ReadMe</a>.
Stay toasty!</p>]]></content><author><name>Mykola Morozov</name><email>mcmikecreations@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A beautiful day out here in Bavaria.
