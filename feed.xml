And an exciting one, where a new major update came to the website!</p>

<p>First, I’ve added a new page to the website, <a href="https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/awetum/">AweTUM</a>,
featuring links to useful study resources and hobby projects of TUM students. If you have anything to add,
just PM/DM me the link with a short description. I hope to make the website a central point for useful
unofficial TUM-related stuff, so any help from you is highly welcome.</p>

<p>Second, I reworked the apps to accept unknown schools, departments and course formats.
This means you can safely ask your friends from Management, Architecture or Biology to contribute their grades!</p>

<p>Don’t forget that as the grades for the 2023SS have rolled out, you can contribute them here!
For that, check out the instructions in the <a href="https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/">ReadMe</a>.
Stay toasty!</p>]]></content><author><name>Mykola Morozov</name><email>mcmikecreations@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A beautiful day out here in Bavaria.

I’ve noticed a big problem with the grade reports at TUM. Pictures that people share are always scattered between several GitHub/GitLab/LRZ/MWN repos and WhatsApp/Telegram/Matrix/Facebook groups. If you don’t know if you should take a course and want to check out previous grades for it, it’s always a hassle.</p>

<p>Moreover, the “My achievements” page on TUMOnline is inconvenient on desktop and unusable on mobile.</p>

<p>This is why I wanted to contribute my share and developed this small website.</p>

<p>It has only the main fields from exam statistics, is highlight- and mobile-friendly and, of course, supports light and dark themes based on your device settings.</p>

<p>The best part — you can easily contribute too! I created a GitHub issue template that looks like this: <a href="https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/issues/3">https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/issues/3</a></p>

<p>You can fill the info in, someone from the development team double-checks if the format is correct, assigns the label, and the bots do the rest to put your submission onto the website!</p>

<p>I hope it supports CIT course numbering too, but haven’t had any examples to check yet. I will try to bring as many exam statistics I find in other repos as possible, but it will be a long process.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to message me or post them on GitHub. My first question to you: do you want the “Persons involved” row from TUMOnline?</p>

<p>Also I need help with making the website more friendly for people with accessibility issues, like vision impairment, so if anyone is familiar with how to do it in HTML/js and can help, any contribution is welcome.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mykola Morozov</name><email>mcmikecreations@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
