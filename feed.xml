<p>The tables there are sortable and contain some useful info (thanks to Jan for the suggestion). The tables are a bit too big for mobile, but you can scroll them horizontally with your finger.</p>

<p>Also added the posts section with messages regarding website updates.</p>

<p>Thanks to Luca for contributing his grade reports! You can do so too by following <a href="https://mcmikecreations.github.io/tum_info/readme/">these instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Now there is a grand total of 109 easy to access grade distributions for your convenience.</p>

I‚Äôve noticed a big problem with the grade reports at TUM. Pictures that people share are always scattered between several GitHub/GitLab/LRZ/MWN repos and WhatsApp/Telegram/Matrix/Facebook groups. If you don‚Äôt know if you should take a course and want to check out previous grades for it, it‚Äôs always a hassle.</p>

<p>Moreover, the ‚ÄúMy achievements‚Äù page on TUMOnline is inconvenient on desktop and unusable on mobile.</p>

<p>This is why I wanted to contribute my share and developed this small website.</p>

<p>It has only the main fields from exam statistics, is highlight- and mobile-friendly and, of course, supports light and dark themes based on your device settings.</p>

<p>The best part ‚Äî you can easily contribute too! I created a GitHub issue template that looks like this: <a href="https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/issues/3">https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/issues/3</a></p>

<p>You can fill the info in, someone from the development team double-checks if the format is correct, assigns the label, and the bots do the rest to put your submission onto the website!</p>

<p>I hope it supports CIT course numbering too, but haven‚Äôt had any examples to check yet. I will try to bring as many exam statistics I find in other repos as possible, but it will be a long process.</p>

<p>If you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to message me or post them on GitHub. My first question to you: do you want the ‚ÄúPersons involved‚Äù row from TUMOnline?</p>

<p>Also I need help with making the website more friendly for people with accessibility issues, like vision impairment, so if anyone is familiar with how to do it in HTML/js and can help, any contribution is welcome.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mykola Morozov</name><email>mcmikecreations@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
