<p>The following is a list of API endpoints the website supports.</p>

<h2 id="courses"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/api/courses.json">/api/courses.json</a></h2>

<p>
    The courses endpoint is a list of all course exam statistics present on the website.
    It contains an unsorted array of all grade report pages without the descriptions.
</p>
<p>
    You can find the grade report summary calculation code in either
    <a href="https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/blob/main/_layouts/course.html">course.html</a>
    or
    <a href="https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/blob/main/assets/js/course.mjs">course.mjs</a>.
    The automatic mapping of <code>hours</code> (semester working hours) to <code>ects</code> for imports can be found in
    <a href="https://github.com/mcmikecreations/tum_info/blob/main/scripts/course_functions.py">course_functions.py</a>.
    It is not always correct, but offers an acceptable default.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>school</code> is one of the items in the schools API.</li>
    <li><code>examType</code> is either <code>endterm</code> or <code>retake</code>.</li>
    <li><code>semester</code> is in the format <code>YYYY(W|S)S</code></li>
    <li><code>name</code> is the full English name of the course from the TUMOnline website.</li>
    <li><code>date</code> is the date and time of the exam. When the contributor doesn't specify it, a default is used, so it shouldn't be relied on.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Imagining this endpoint to be exported from a database, <code>&lt;school,code,semester,examType&gt;</code>
    would be the unique primary key.

<h2 id="schools"><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/api/schools.json">/api/schools.json</a></h2>

<p>
    The schools endpoint is a list of all supported schools, institutes, and departments present on the website.
    It contains an unsorted array of all school pages without the descriptions.
</p>
<p>
    Note that this list is incomplete and is expanded manually when a course from a new school or department is added.
    The course code prefix is compared against <code>deps</code> to assign a school.
